### Problem 4 - Closest Pair (20 points)

+ Given an array of point coordinates $P$, find the minimum distance between two points in the array, return the distance.
+ **5pts.** Implement a brute-force solution as `minDistBrute()` method in [src/Problem4.java](src/Problem4.java).
+ **5pts.** Implement a divide-and-conquer efficient solution as `minDistSmart()` method in [src/Problem4.java](src/Problem4.java).
+ **5pts.** Describe in written form your solution ideas in the **Report** section below.
+ **5pts.** Defend your solutions to your instructor in live during practice sessions.
+ Your code will be tested against various inputs using `JUnit6` testing framework.
+ **Don't change API** of the solutions in [src/Problem4.java](src/Problem4.java).

#### Example
+ Input: `P = {{0,0},{3,4},{-5,-3}}`
+ Output: `5.0`

#### Constraints
+ $1 \leq P.length \leq 10^5$
+ $P[i][j]$ is of type `double`

### Report

**Approach.** `minDistBrute` checks every point pair in Θ(n²) time. `minDistSmart` sorts points, recursively solves each half, and checks a y-ordered strip around the split line, taking Θ(n log n) time and Θ(n) auxiliary space. Both return 0.0 for fewer than two points. The measured comparison and full analysis are in [REPORT.md](REPORT.md).

### Defense Interview
+ Be ready to justify running times, for example using **Master method** for divide-and-conquer algorithms.
+ Be ready to answer questions on algorithms and your code.
+ Be ready to run your code and test it on various inputs.

Good Luck!
