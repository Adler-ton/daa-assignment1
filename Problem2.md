### Problem 2 - Median of Two Sorted Arrays (20 points)

+ Given two sorted arrays $A$ and $B$ of sizes $n$ and $m$ respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays. If there are two medians return the average of them. 
+ **5pts.** Implement a brute-force solution as `getMedianBrute()` method in [src/Problem2.java](src/Problem2.java). 
+ **5pts.** Implement a divide-and-conquer efficient solution as `getMedianSmart()` method in [src/Problem2.java](src/Problem2.java).
+ **5pts.** Describe in written form your solution ideas in the **Report** section below.
+ **5pts.** Defend your solutions to your instructor in live during practice sessions.
+ Your code will be tested against various inputs using `JUnit6` testing framework.
+ **Don't change API** of the solutions in [src/Problem2.java](src/Problem2.java).

#### Example 1
+ Input: `A={2,4}, B={3}`
+ Output: `3.0`

#### Example 2
+ Input: `A={2,4}, B={3,5}`
+ Output: `3.5`

#### Constraints
+ $0 \leq n,m \leq 1000$
+ $1 \leq (n+m) \leq 2000$
+ $-10^6 \leq A[i],B[i] \leq 10^6$
+ $A$ and $B$ are sorted in non-descending order

### Report

**Approach.** `getMedianBrute` merges the sorted arrays and selects the middle value(s), using Θ(n+m) time and Θ(n+m) extra space. `getMedianSmart` binary-searches a valid partition in the shorter array, taking Θ(log(min(n,m)+1)) time and Θ(1) extra space. The measured comparison and full analysis are in [REPORT.md](REPORT.md).

### Defense Interview 
+ Be ready to justify running times, for example using **Master method** for divide-and-conquer algorithms.
+ Be ready to answer questions on algorithms and your code.
+ Be ready to run your code and test it on various inputs.

Good Luck!
