### Problem 1 - Number of Occurrences (20 points)

+ Count the number of times a given key $k$ occurs in a given sorted array $A$.
+ **5pts.** Implement a brute-force solution as `countFreqBrute()` method in [src/Problem1.java](src/Problem1.java). 
+ **5pts.** Implement a divide-and-conquer efficient solution as `countFreqSmart()` method in [src/Problem1.java](src/Problem1.java).
+ **5pts.** Describe in written form your solution ideas in the **Report** section below.
+ **5pts.** Defend your solutions to your instructor in live during practice sessions.
+ Your code will be tested against various inputs using `JUnit6` testing framework.
+ **Don't change API** of the solutions in [src/Problem1.java](src/Problem1.java).
#### Example 1
+ Input: `A = {1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,5,5,5,5}, key = 4`
+ Output: `3`

#### Example 2
+ Input:  `A = {1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,5,5,5,5}, key = 3`
+ Output: `0`

#### Constraints
+ $0 \leq A.length \leq 10^5$
+ $-10^9 \leq A[i] \leq 10^9$
+ $-10^9 \leq key \leq 10^9$
+ $A$ is sorted in non-descending order

### Report

**Approach.** `countFreqBrute` scans all values in Θ(n) time and Θ(1) extra space. `countFreqSmart` performs lower-bound and upper-bound binary searches and subtracts their indices, taking Θ(log n) time and Θ(1) extra space. The measured comparison and full analysis are in [REPORT.md](REPORT.md).

### Defense Interview 
+ Be ready to justify running times, for example using **Master method** for divide-and-conquer algorithms.
+ Be ready to answer questions on algorithms and your code.
+ Be ready to run your code and test it on various inputs. 

Good Luck!
